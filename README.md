The project is not functional, nor does it have a specific concept in mind. It's just a "stock" website intended for DOM exploration and css prsctices. 
Each of the main elements (navbar, sidebar, content and footer) has some placeholder information without real meaning, just for the sake os visualization
None of the <a> elements in either the navbar or the sidebar have a link to redirect users to, nor any other type of function other than being seen
